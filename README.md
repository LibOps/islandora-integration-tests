Tie together [isle-buildkit](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/isle-buildkit/) docker images, [isle-site-template](https://github.com/islandora-Devops/isle-site-template) container orchestration, [islandora-starter-site](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-starter-site) Drupal codebase+config in order to run integration tests.

## Requirements for local testing

Same requirements as [isle-site-template](https://github.com/islandora-Devops/isle-site-template?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements)

### Mac OS

The scripts in this repo need a newer version of bash than what comes as the default with Mac OS. You can install a newer version with

```
brew install bash
```
